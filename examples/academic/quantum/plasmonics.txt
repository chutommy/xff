Quantum plasmonics is a rapidly growing field of research that involves the study of the quantum properties of light and its interaction with matter at the nanoscale. Here, surface plasmons—electromagnetic excitations coupled to electron charge density waves on metal–dielectric interfaces or localized on metallic nanostructures—enable the confinement of light to scales far below that of conventional optics. We review recent progress in the experimental and theoretical investigation of the quantum properties of surface plasmons, their role in controlling light–matter interactions at the quantum level and potential applications. Quantum plasmonics opens up a new frontier in the study of the fundamental physics of surface plasmons and the realization of quantum-controlled devices, including single-photon sources, transistors and ultra-compact circuitry at the nanoscale.
